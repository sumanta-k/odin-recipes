	<h2>Description</h2>
  <p><strong>Skillet Chicken Bulgogi</strong> is a Korean-inspired dish that features thinly sliced or bite-sized chicken pieces marinated in a flavorful mixture of soy sauce, garlic, ginger, sesame oil, and sugar, often with the addition of gochujang (Korean chili paste) for a spicy kick. The marinade is slightly sweet, savory, and smoky, giving the chicken a complex and irresistible taste.</P>

  <p>The dish is cooked in a hot skillet, which helps caramelize the marinade and creates a delicious glaze on the chicken. It’s typically garnished with sesame seeds and green onions, adding texture and freshness. Skillet Chicken Bulgogi is quick to prepare, making it perfect for weeknight dinners.</P>
 

 <p>It’s often served with steamed rice, lettuce wraps, or kimchi, and it pairs wonderfully with pickled vegetables or a side of spicy Korean cucumber salad. The dish strikes a balance of bold and comforting flavors, making it a favorite for both beginners and Korean food enthusiasts.</P>
